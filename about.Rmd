I head the Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences at the University of Basel [CDS](https://cds.unibas.ch/). 

I am a psychologist interested in individual and age differences in decision making, and their implications for health, wealth, and well-being. 

You can find an automated list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?hl=en&user=dIJjxc4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Please visit my [personal webpage](https://matarui.org/) to learn more about my research, teaching, and outreach projects.
