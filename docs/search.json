In this workshop, you will create your very own\nwebsite using R Markdown\nand Distill. No\nprevious programming skills are required; you will start with a\ntemplate, and then, step-by-step, add to this website template to\nrepresent you, your science, your teaching, your outreach activities,\netc. You will also learn how and where to host your website. This\nwebsite is a simple example of how your own website in Distill could look\nlike!\nPreparations for the\nworkshop\nFor the workshop, there are some simple\nprerequisites. Please make sure all the following points are\nready on your laptop before you come to the\nworkshop.\nInstall\nR and RStudio\nInstall the the following packages in RStudio:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"distill\", \"rmarkdown\", \"postcards\"))\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub account\nInstall GitHub\nDesktop\nOn the day of the workshop, bring your laptop and\nany material you want on your website (photo, text\nabout you, your project analyses in R, instructions for\nmaking bagels etc..).\nIf you have any trouble with the preparations, please send Gayoung an email!\n\n\n\n",
