In this workshop, you will create your very own professional website using R Markdown and Distill. No previous programming skills are required; you will start with a template, and then, step-by-step, add to this website template to represent you, your science, your teaching, your outreach activities, etc. You will also learn how and where to host your website. This website is a simple example of how your own website in Distill could look like!\r\nPreparations for the workshop\r\nFor the workshop, there are some simple prerequisites. Please make sure all the following points are ready on your laptop before you come to the workshop.\r\nInstall R and RStudio\r\nInstall the the following packages in RStudio:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"distill\", \"rmarkdown\", \"postcards\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a GitHub account\r\nInstall GitHub Desktop\r\nOn the day of the workshop, bring your laptop and any material you want on your website (photo, text about you, your project analyses in R, instructions for making bagels etc..).\r\nIf you have any trouble with the preparations, please send Gayoung an email!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
