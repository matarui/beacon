In this workshop, you will create your very own\nwebsite using R Markdown\nand Distill. No\nprevious programming skills are required; you will start with a\ntemplate, and then, step-by-step, add to this website template to\nrepresent you, your science, your teaching, your outreach activities,\netc. You will also learn how and where to host your website. This\nwebsite is a simple example of how your own website in Distill could look\nlike!\nPreparations for the\nworkshop\nFor the workshop, there are some simple\nprerequisites. Please make sure all the following points are\nready on your laptop before you come to the\nworkshop.\nInstall\nR and RStudio\nInstall the the following packages in RStudio:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"distill\", \"rmarkdown\", \"postcards\"))\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub account\nInstall GitHub\nDesktop\nOn the day of the workshop, bring your laptop and\nany material you want on your website (photo, text\nabout you, your project analyses in R, instructions for\nmaking bagels etc..).\nIf you have any trouble with the preparations, please send Gayoung an email!\n\n\n\n",

Maybe you need to install the newest version of the\npackages! Otherwise, google üòÑ\nMake a new R Project by clicking on the New Project\nbutton. \nClick on New Directory, than select Distill\nWebsite from the list.\nGive your Website a directory name (a.k.a. name the folder), the\ntitle of your website (can be changed later) and check the box to\nconfigure for Github Pages! Now you have created a basic\ntemplate. Make sure to save your .Rmd (R Markdown) files and\nrender_site(), so that your .Rmd will be made into\n.html.\nInstead of render_site(), you can also click on\nüî® Build\nWebsite.\n\nUploading your website on\nGitHub\nYour website template is there, but no one see it yet, because it is\nnot ‚Äúin the cloud‚Äù. For this, we will use GitHub Pages.\nGo to GitHub and create a new repository. You can click\non the plus button on the top right corner.\nGive your new repository a name, add a README file and .gitignore\nlike shown in the screenshot below. Then create! \nGo to the Settings of your repository, click on\nPages and change the Branch to the docs\nfolder and save.This tells GitHub where to find your .html files. \nIn your GitHub Desktop, clone\nyour new repository onto your laptop.\nMove all the contents of your basic template website\ninto the cloned folder!\nMake sure you don‚Äôt copy the folder but only the contents, also the\nhidden ones!\n\nIn your GitHub Desktop, commit\nand push!\nCongratulations, you have made your website! ‚ú®\n\n\nVersion 2\nA second, more elegant version of creating a website in\nGitHub, without having to copy your website template into the repo. This\nway will allow you to create an R Project directly inside your\nrepository.\nCreate a new repository in GitHub, configure it for GitHub Pages\nin the setting and clone it onto your laptop.\nThe instructions are in Setting up (version 1).\n\nOpen RStudio and create a new project, however, this time click\nthe option Existing Directory, as shown in the\nscreenshot below.  Make sure to set your Project Working\nDirectory to the cloned repository folder on your\nlaptop!\nNow you will have a blank R Project with no Distill Website\nTemplate, but don‚Äôt fret! Just type the following line into the console,\nthen enter your website title! Now you have a website template. Make\nsure to save and render_site().\n\n\ndistill::create_website(dir = getwd(), gh_pages = TRUE)\n\n\n\nNow the only thing left is to commit\nand push your changes in GitHub Desktop.\nCongratulations! You have made your website. ‚ú®\n\n\nAdditional Links\nNow the only thing left is to personalize your website and to add\ncontent! Please check out the official Distill\nwebsite for great step-by-step instructions on how to build the\nsite. Please check out the tutorial from the Distillery\non how to make an about me page. If you want to understand more\nof R Markdown, we recommend this webinar from Alison Hill and Desir√©e De\nLeon.\n\n\n\n\nSharing\non Short Notice: How to Get Your Materials Online With R Markdown -\nRStudio\n\n\n\n\n",
