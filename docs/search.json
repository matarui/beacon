In this workshop, you will create your very own\r\nprofessional website using R\r\nMarkdown and Distill. No previous\r\nprogramming skills are required; you will start with a template, and\r\nthen, step-by-step, add to this website template to represent you, your\r\nscience, your teaching, your outreach activities, etc. You will also\r\nlearn how and where to host your website. This website is a simple\r\nexample of how your own website in Distill could look\r\nlike!\r\nPreparations for the\r\nworkshop\r\nFor the workshop, there are some simple\r\nprerequisites. Please make sure all the following points are\r\nready on your laptop before you come to the\r\nworkshop.\r\nInstall\r\nR and RStudio\r\nInstall the the following packages in RStudio:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"distill\", \"rmarkdown\", \"postcards\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a GitHub account\r\nInstall GitHub\r\nDesktop\r\nOn the day of the workshop, bring your laptop and\r\nany material you want on your website (photo, text\r\nabout you, your project analyses in R, etc..).\r\nIf you have any trouble with the preparations, please send Gayoung an email!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
